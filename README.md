<h1> Age Detection from Image</h1>
The objective of my project entitled “AGE DETECTION FROM IMAGE” is to detect the age of the person by giving the front side face image as input. 


  
  
  <h3> Database used : UTKFace </h3>
  For this project the dataset named as UTKFace has been used which was downloaded from Kaggle. The dataset contains images of people with ages from 1 to 116. The name of each image has the first letter as the age of the person whose image it is. Each image is of size 200 X 200 pixels in Width X Height. There are around 23700 images in the dataset on which learning and training is to be performed.
